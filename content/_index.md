- Better grass and snow
- OptiFine donator capes (and [free capes](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Supporter-cape))

There are also these other features:

- Free, simple world hosting
    - Simply click "Open Externally" in the menu of your world, and you'll get a shareable IP
- Modularity
    - This allows you to disable features that are incompatible with other mods, or features you don't like
- Fast updates
