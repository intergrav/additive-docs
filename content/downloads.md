# Installing for the Mojang launcher

If you don't want to install any third-party stuff, you can use the Additive installer which lets you select a version to download and install to the Minecraft launcher. This is an unofficial installer made by Gaming32 - please go [here](https://github.com/Gaming32/additive-installer/issues) to report issues and suggest features for it.

Here are the different downloads (links will be available soon):

- '.exe' variant (Windows)
- '.jar' variant (Linux, MacOS, etc)

# Installing with third-party launchers

If you prefer to use a third-party option such as Prism Launcher, ATLauncher, or anything else that supports Modrinth modpacks, simply [follow the instructions from Modrinth](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/).

Assuming you [already have it set up](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-prismlauncher), here's the instructions if you are on Prism Launcher, which is what I personally recommend and use:

1. Click "+ Add Instance"
2. Click the "Modrinth" tab
3. Select either Additive for performance and OptiFine features, *or* Adrenaline for strictly performance features.
4. Select the version you want at the bottom left of the dialog.
5. Click "OK" to start installing.
6. Open the instance to play!
